        "introduction": "Due to reduced power production, Belgium may encounter power shortages this winter. To mitigate a complete power failure, the Belgian Government has announced a <a href=\"http://economie.fgov.be/nl/consument/Energie/Energiebevoorradingszekerheid/Crisisbeleid/elektriciteit/afschakeling/afschakelplan/\">rolling blackout plan</a>, in which parts of municipalities and districts are temporarily cut off from power at a known time. These cut offs are grouped in sections, which you can select below. If your municipality is not dark green, you may experience a couple of hours without electricity. To see details per district, just select your municipality on the map.<br><b>Update:</b> The rolling blackout plan contains a geographical imbalance. To correct this imbalance, the plan was recently adjusted. We did not take this correction into account during the creation of the map.
