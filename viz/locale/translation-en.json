        "introduction": "Due to reduced power production, Belgium may encounter power shortages this winter. To mitigate a complete power failure, the Belgian Government has announced a <a href=\"http://economie.fgov.be/nl/consument/Energie/Energiebevoorradingszekerheid/Crisisbeleid/elektriciteit/afschakeling/afschakelplan/\">rolling blackout plan</a>, in which parts of municipalities and districts are temporarily cut off from power at a known time. These cut offs are grouped in sections, which you can select below. If your municipality is not <span class=\"light-yellow\">light yellow</span>, you may experience a couple of hours without electricity. To see details per district, just select your municipality on the map.",
        "alert": "This visualization won't work <em>during</em> a blackout. :-) On September 12, the rolling blackout plan was adjusted to correct a geographical imbalance (see <a href=\"http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140912_01264343\">Dutch</a> or <a href=\"http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/black-out-le-plan-de-delestage-va-etre-modifie-5412ec0135708a6d4d558a4d\">French</a> article). We didn't take this into consideration during the creation of the map."
